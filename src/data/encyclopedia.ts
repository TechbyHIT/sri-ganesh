  "invisible-grills": {
    how: "Each run is a measured stainless cable, terminated at an anchor that matches the wall or slab. Spacing is a household decision: closer for a toddler or a cat, wider for general fall protection. The outlook stays open because there is no welded lattice, only lines under tension.",
    compare: "Choose cable when the opening is a clear rectangle or a simple L and the view matters. Choose a safety net when columns, ducts or a wide irregular span would leave gaps between lines. Iron grills remain a third, heavier option that blocks breeze and rusts faster on the Andhra coast.",
    climate: "On the Bay — Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Machilipatnam, Chirala, Nellore — salt and long humidity belong in the metal talk. In Rayalaseema the usual stress is heat and dust, so SS304 and a clean substrate matter more than marine cable. The Godavari and Krishna towns sit between those two stories.",
    spec: "Quotes name SS304 or SS316, the number of lines, turnbuckle type and how the wall will take the load. 'Premium stainless' without a grade is not a specification.",
  },
  "safety-nets": {
    how: "A safety net is a tensioned mesh panel with a border rope, hooked around an opening so people, pets and objects are far less likely to pass through. Edges, corners and pipes are part of the measure. A net hooked only at four corners is a hammock, not a barrier.",
    compare: "Mesh suits wide, broken or soft-contact openings. Cable suits a neat view-led balcony. Mosquito screens are a different product with a different yarn. Building-covering nets for a work face are heavier still and quoted as site work.",
    climate: "UV-stabilised HDPE is the default against Andhra sun. Coastal wind asks for denser hook lines. Inland terraces fail from ultraviolet brittleness more than from rust.",
    spec: "Mesh aperture, yarn type, border rope and hook metal are written down. Colour is a society conversation, not a surprise on the elevation.",
  },
  "balcony-safety-nets": {
    how: "The panel runs from the balcony railing up to the slab, including side returns beside a column. Transparent-looking mesh is still a fall barrier: it is chosen for even tension and a quiet elevation, not for disappearing entirely.",
    compare: "A balcony net and an invisible grill can share one flat. The net covers the climb gap; the grill keeps a French window open to the view. They are measured together so the hanger, the door and the hook line do not fight.",
    climate: "West-facing balconies in Guntur, Eluru and Kadapa take a harder sun. Sea-facing balconies in Visakhapatnam take salt. Both need a named mesh and a named hook.",
    spec: "Railing-to-slab height, run length, columns and whether a release edge is required all appear on the quote.",
  },
  "children-safety-nets": {
    how: "Spacing and yarn are chosen for pull, climb and lean. Anchors sit where a child cannot work them loose. The panel is soft on contact compared with iron, and it is still a barrier, not a play structure.",
    compare: "If the opening is a clean span and the family wants a near-invisible line, closer-spaced cable may be the better brief. If the balcony is broken by planters and columns, mesh usually wins. Supervision is not optional in either case.",
    climate: "Humid towns keep hooks stainless. Dry towns keep the yarn UV-stable. The child is the same; the weather is not.",
    spec: "Age of the child, other openings on the same floor, and stair voids are asked before the mesh is cut.",
  },
  "pet-safety-nets": {
    how: "Cats test corners. Dogs lean with their weight. The aperture is smaller than a general balcony net, and the lower edge is tied so it cannot be nosed up.",
    compare: "A pet net is not a pigeon net with a different label. Bird mesh can still pass a slim cat. Tell us the animal before we guess the hole size.",
    climate: "Chew-risk edges get covered hooks in any district. Coastal rust on a cheap hook is how a gap starts.",
    spec: "Pet type, balcony length and any sliding-shutter gap are measured as one brief.",
  },
  "cat-safety-nets": {
    how: "A cat safety net is a tight-aperture balcony or window panel planned around how cats sit on railings and slip through corners that look closed to an adult.",
    compare: "General pet mesh may still be too open for a slim cat. Invisible-grill spacing for a cat is a different, closer cable brief. We pick one system after seeing the gap.",
    climate: "Upper-floor flats in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada are the usual call. The climate note follows the city; the aperture follows the cat.",
    spec: "Window sills, planter ledges and the gap under a sliding door are included, not only the pretty mid-rail.",
  },
  "pigeon-nets": {
    how: "The net closes the volume birds occupy — the balcony box, the duct, the pocket beside an AC tray — and the last edge is closed only after birds already inside can leave.",
    compare: "Use spikes when birds only perch on a thin ledge. Use a net when they walk in under the slab. Many buildings need both. Poison and gel are not alternatives we sell.",
    climate: "Close-built delta towns and coastal apartment ledges are the classic roost. Rayalaseema parapets are often a spike job unless the balcony itself is open.",
    spec: "Volume, pipes, and whether old nesting must be cleared are line items.",
  },
  "bird-nets": {
    how: "Bird nets are the broader exclusion job: pigeons at home, mixed birds on sheds and shafts. Aperture follows the species we actually see, not a catalogue photo of a balcony.",
    compare: "A balcony pigeon net and a warehouse bird net share a method and not a price. Span and roof type change the support.",
    climate: "Sheet roofs in Hindupur and coastal sheds in Kakinada take different fixings. The mesh talk stays UV-aware everywhere.",
    spec: "Species, span and a documented access opening for maintenance.",
  },
  "anti-bird-spikes": {
    how: "Blunt stainless pins on a base strip stop a comfortable landing. They are a deterrent, not a trap, and they sit on parapets, sunshades, signboards and AC trays.",
    compare: "Spikes fail inside a balcony children can reach. Nets fail as a replacement for a thin ledge. We recommend after seeing the roost.",
    climate: "Plastic pins chalk in Rayalaseema sun. Stainless is the default conversation on hot parapets.",
    spec: "Running metres, surface and whether adhesive or a mechanical fix will hold.",
  },
  "duct-area-nets": {
    how: "The shaft face is closed at the agreed floors, with a labelled flap so a plumber can still reach the pipe. A fully sealed duct is a future cut.",
    compare: "Balcony pigeon nets do not automatically scale to a multi-floor shaft. Association permission is usual because the duct is common property.",
    climate: "Coastal and delta shafts hold nests and smell. Inland shafts still collect birds; UV still matters on the open face.",
    spec: "Floors covered, shaft size, clutter and the access note for the committee.",
  },
  "terrace-safety-nets": {
    how: "Edge nets close a fall. Overhead nets close birds or falling objects from above. They are quoted separately so a house does not buy a sky cage by default.",
    compare: "A balcony net is not a terrace edge. A sports net is not a terrace shade. Poles on a waterproofed slab are a structural question first.",
    climate: "Rayalaseema UV and coastal wind are the two honest risks. Neither is solved by a light decorative mesh.",
    spec: "Parapet height, water tanks, solar frames and whether the brief is fall, birds, or both.",
  },
  "staircase-safety-nets": {
    how: "The panel follows the rake of the flight and the landing. Triangular gaps under the first flight are included. Tension must not pull a loose handrail out of line.",
    compare: "Invisible cable can close a straight void. Mesh follows a turning stair more calmly. Iron infill closes the look as well as the gap.",
    climate: "Duplex houses in Tadepalligudem, Eluru and newer Guntur layouts are typical. Dust and humidity change the hook, not the geometry.",
    spec: "Number of flights, void width and the handrail's own screws — we avoid loading those if we can.",
  },
  "cloth-hangers": {
    how: "Ceiling pulleys and wall rods lift drying off the floor. Span, drop and rod count come from the slab, the fan and the wash load.",
    compare: "A hanger can share a balcony with a net or a grill if both are measured in one visit. A floor rack is not a specification.",
    climate: "Humid Godavari and coastal towns stain mild steel onto clothes. Aluminium or stainless rods are the named alternative.",
    spec: "Rod length, pulley type and the heaviest wash you actually hang.",
  },
  "sports-nets": {
    how: "Practice and perimeter nets are built to the bay: height, pole spacing and yarn follow the sport, not a balcony price list.",
    compare: "A house terrace may not take poles. A school ground is a different foundation. We say so before anyone drills a slab.",
    climate: "Sun on inland grounds and wind on coastal fields both belong in the pole and guy plan.",
    spec: "Sport, bay size, height and whether a top net is required.",
  },
  "cricket-nets": {
    how: "Lanes need a hitting-face yarn that is heavier than the sides, a back net, and a height that keeps the ball off the next roof.",
    compare: "Backyard practice is not a district academy. The quote should not pretend they are the same lane.",
    climate: "Open grounds in Guntur, Kurnool and Anantapur take UV and dust. Coastal academies add a corrosion note on poles.",
    spec: "Lane count, run-up, surface and neighbour line.",
  },
  "mosquito-nets": {
    how: "Fine insect mesh on a stitched or framed panel follows the shutter. It keeps mosquitoes out. It does not stop a fall.",
    compare: "Delta evenings often need both a fall net and a screen. They are two lines. One product cannot honestly do both.",
    climate: "Konaseema, Kakinada and the Godavari towns are the usual insect brief. Rayalaseema still has seasons; the product remains a screen.",
    spec: "Shutter type, opening count and whether a door sees daily traffic.",
  },
  "monkey-safety-nets": {
    how: "Monkey-prone openings — hill-edge houses, fruit trees beside a terrace, foothill flats — need a tougher yarn and a fixing that survives a pull, not only a pigeon landing.",
    compare: "A pigeon net will fail here. A child safety net may still be too light. We assess the site before we reuse a balcony specification.",
    climate: "Eastern Ghats approaches around Narsipatnam, Paderu, Tirupati foothills and agency-side towns are the honest geography. We do not advertise monkeys in a delta flat that has never seen one.",
    spec: "Opening type, tree cover and whether the brief is exclusion or a combined child-and-wildlife barrier.",
  },
  "building-covering-nets": {
    how: "Building-covering nets are project mesh for an elevation, a work face or a temporary enclosure. Fixing, overlap and access for the trade on site are the brief.",
    compare: "This is not a house balcony package and not a sports lane. Schools, hospitals and towers are scoped after a walk, often with the contractor or association.",
    climate: "Wind on a tall Visakhapatnam or Vijayawada face is a structural conversation. We will not call a light net a cyclone screen.",
    spec: "Area, height, duration of cover and who controls access to the facade.",
  },
  "transparent-balcony-nets": {
    how: "A finer, lower-visibility balcony mesh is still a fall panel. Light and outlook are part of the plan; strength and even tension remain the first requirements.",
    compare: "If the family wants almost no visual weight, invisible cable may be cleaner. If the balcony is irregular, a quieter mesh is usually the calmer fit.",
    climate: "Dark mesh reads quieter on most Andhra elevations. Society colour rules are checked before the yarn is ordered.",
    spec: "Aperture, colour and whether the panel must unhook for painting.",
